Approaches

Contacts
-plot number of contacts against credit scores (scatter plot), report basic stats
-would be curious to consider average credit score of userâ€™s contacts, if available (probably not, since only 400 users)

Call Records
-consider number of calls, average length of calls among users
-visualize subpopulation of users who call at each time of day

Messages
-consider number of messages, average length
-identify types of messages (payment notification, billing notice)


After exploratory analysis, brainstorm effective ways to segment the user population.
